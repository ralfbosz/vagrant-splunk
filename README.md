# vagrant-splunk

This Vagrantfile is created to setup a Splunk server using Puppet.
With "puppet-splunk" the Splunk server is installed, just add the
RPM to the root of this directory and run vagrant up.

Next step is a client which connects to this server, but that is
for another commit.

Feel free to help me enchance this, my knowledge of Vagrant is
very newby, just wanted to create a fast way to make a Splunk
server for fun and couldn't find any Vagrant examples which
are still active supported...
