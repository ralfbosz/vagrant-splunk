# vagrant-splunk

Welcome to my vagrant-splunk implementation.

## Requirements

No more requiremens, the new version of the module downloads the software itself, onlye specify the version and build, and your good to go !  

## Getting started

Just start the boxes up:

``vagrant up``

## Wishes/ToDo

- Make the modules available locally, so the server and client don't need to download it seperatly  
- Download the Splunk software automatically  

## Fork/Push/Pull

Feel free to fork this repo and make changes as PR available.
